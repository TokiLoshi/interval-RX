# IntervalRX

Your prescription to move more during the day and break bad posture habits.

## What is it

IntervalRx is a REPL-based project using timers, a Tkinter GUI, and schedulers to remind you when itâ€™s time to take a mobility break. It helps you stay consistent with your physiotherapy exercises while working at your desk, so you get the most out of your physio.

## How to Run it

Instructions coming soon.
